<h2>Modems</h2>

<p>
    Modem (modulator-demodulator) converts a digital signal of a computer into analogue signal for transmission over an existing telephone line. <br>
    It also does the opposite thing, to enable the computer to process the data, it coverts analogue signals from a telephone line into digital signals.

    Hubs

</h2>

<p>
    Hubs are hardware devices that can have devices connected to them. They connect together to form LAN (local area network). <br>
    Its job is to receive data packets (group of data) and show them to every computer that uses the network. <br>
    It's not stable so it's not the best way to give out data.

<h2>Bridge</h2>
    
<p>
    A bridge connects a LAN to another LAN that uses the same protocol. They connect so that both LANs can work the same like itâ€™s the same LAN.
